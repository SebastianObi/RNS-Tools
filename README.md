# RNS-Tools
Various small programs and tools which use the Reticulum Network Stack RNS from https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum


## General Information for all tools/programs


### Current Status:
It should currently be considered beta software and still work in progress.

All core features are implemented and functioning, but additions will probably occur as real-world use is explored.

There may be errors or the compatibility after an update is no longer guaranteed.

The full documentation is not yet available. Due to lack of time I can also not say when this will be further processed.
